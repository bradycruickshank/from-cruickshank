# Brady Cruickshank

My favorite song is The Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel. It's a classic folk rock song from the 1960s. The original version of the song was just acoustic guitar and vocals. The song didn't become popular until a radio dj created a new version of the song which added electric guitar, drums, and bass to the original recording.
